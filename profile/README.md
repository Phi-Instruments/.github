## 🎯 About

**Phi Instruments** is a research-driven collective creating **programmable hardware synthesizers** and the **tools to shape them**.  
At the core of our work is **Slang** — a lightweight, expressive **audio programming language** designed for real-time synthesis and embedded control.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🎛️ TalkShow
A modular synthesizer platform built for deep customization.  
TalkShow is **not just an instrument** — it’s a development environment for audio experimentation.

- **Slang-native**: Every synth is programmable using the Slang language
- **Modular design**: Hardware blocks with patchable audio/CV routing
- **Live reprogramming**: Tweak synthesis logic on the fly
- **Open hardware**: Fully documented schematics and firmware

### 💬 Slang
A purpose-built programming language for **defining synthesis logic** and **interfacing with TalkShow hardware**.

- Designed for embedded audio processing
- Expressive enough for live patching and composition
- Deterministic, efficient, and small-footprint
- Fully open-source
- 
### 🧪 Workbench
A lightweight desktop application for **testing and developing Slang programs** on your PC.

- Run and preview Slang patches in real time
- Simple UI for writing and debugging audio code
- Built to match the behavior of Slang on hardware
- Ideal for prototyping without needing TalkShow connected

## 🌀 Philosophy

- **Programmability first** – Instruments should be moldable, not fixed
- **Open development** – All our designs are public and hackable
- **Sonic research** – We build tools to explore sound, not to chase trends
